# am-silenced

A small go program to schedule the Alert Manager silences on daily basis using the cron syntax.

The working directory from where you run the program should have process.yaml and config.yaml . See the files included in the repository for configuration syntax.

The matchers are used in same way as we would use them while creating silence from the Web UI.
